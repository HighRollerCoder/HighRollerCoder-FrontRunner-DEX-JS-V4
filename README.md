## 📚 What is Frontrunning?

Frontrunning is a trading strategy that exploits the slippage caused when large token trades are made on decentralized exchanges.

> When someone initiates a swap on a DEX, the token price can move slightly — this is called **slippage**. For small traders, it’s minor. For whales, it can shift the price significantly.

**Frontrunning bots** beat the trader by paying higher gas fees and executing transactions before and after the trader’s transaction (a "sandwich"):

- Buy before the trade
- Let the whale push up the price
- Sell immediately after for profit

In a block explorer, this pattern shows the users transaction being sandwiched between two bot transactions.
